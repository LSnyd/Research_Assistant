# About this project

In this repo, I am finetuning GPT-2 on the [ML-ArXiv-Papers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers) dataset to create my own research assistant who will generate titles for manuscripts based on a given abstract from the field of Machine Learning. 
This is still an experimental project, which does not give great results yet.
